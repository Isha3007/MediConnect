Please follow these guidelines to ensure the transcription is as correct as possible:
1. **Preserve Line Structure**: Transcribe the text exactly as it appears in the image, including line breaks.
2. **Avoid Splitting Words**: Ensure that words are fully formed, even if they appear across two lines or are partially obscured. Join word parts together appropriately to create complete words.
3. **Correct Unnatural Spacing**: Do not add extra spaces between characters in a word. Make sure the words are spaced naturally, without any unwanted breaks or gaps.
4. **Recognize and Correct Word Breaks**: If any word is mistakenly broken into parts, join them correctly to produce a natural, readable word. 
5. **No Additional Comments or Analysis**: Provide only the raw text as it appears in the image, without any additional analysis, comments, or summaries.
6. **Output as a Block of Text**: Output the entire transcribed text as a block, maintaining the line breaks, but ensuring that each word appears as it should, with correct spelling, no character-level splits, and no hyphenations unless they appear naturally in the image.
7. **Don't summarize the text, just transcribe it as it is.**"""
