In modern healthcare, efficient communication between doctors and patients—and effective access to patient data—are critical for accurate and timely diagnosis. Traditional methods of reviewing medical documents are time-consuming and prone to human error. To address this, we propose a smart doctor-patient chatbot that leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. By combining document retrieval with the generative power of LLMs, the system aims to enhance diagnostic efficiency, reduce manual workload, and ultimately improve patient care.
